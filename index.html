<h1>What is a planning problem?</h1>
<p>A business planning problem is the difficulty which is inherent in the organizing of limited resources. The difficulty is caused by the large number of possible arrangements that need to be checked as potential best solutions.
</p>
<p>
Many common and seemingly simple business operations start off small enough to be planned manually, but grow to a size that makes finding the best plan impossible using traditional methods.
 </p>
<p>A classic example is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">traveling salesman problem</a>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Solving your planning problem with Talos Solver is straightforward. First, a solution is defined in terms of what is necessary and what is ideal. Second, an algorithm is created to measure any proposed or existing solutions. Next, a search algorithm is created to efficiently search for and compare solutions. Finally, the process is integrated into your work flow, allowing it to be accessed whenever it is needed. </p>

<h1>Current Projects</h1>
<p><b>24 hour scheduling for Alberta Health Services Emergency Department physicians</b> - Doctors work around the clock and at various
hospitals across Calgary. Creating a fair, safe and enjoyable work schedule becomes difficult to do by hand with more than about 20 doctors at a single location,
and impossible when there is more 80 at multiple locations. Talos Solver is used to generate the best possible schedule, and then 
allow for editing the result to meet specific cases. 
 </p>
 <p> <b>Calgary Transit vehicle selection and timing </b>- With hundreds of vehicles, thousands of routes, and hundreds of thousands 
 passengers per day, Calgary Transit has a huge planning problem. The timing and selection of vehicles is feasible: most people get 
 to where they're going on time. However, many buses pass by stops full, and the routes are not planned to a degree that assures they're
 being run at the lowest cost possible. Optimzing the routes with Talos Planner provides a way to both improve service and lower cost.
