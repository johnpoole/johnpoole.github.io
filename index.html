<h1>What is a planning problem?</h1>
<p>A business planning problem is the difficulty which is inherent in the organizing of limited resources. The difficulty is caused by the large number of possible arrangements that need to be checked as potential best solutions.
</p>
<p>
Many common and seemingly simple business operations start off small enough to be planned manually, but grow to a size that makes finding the best plan impossible using traditional methods.
 </p>
<p>A classic example is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem">traveling salesman problem</a>
</p>

<h1>Solution</h1>
<p>Solving your planning problem with Talos Solver is straightforward. First, a solution is defined in terms of what is necessary and what is ideal. Second, an algorithm is created to measure any proposed or existing solutions. Next, a search algorithm is created to efficiently search for and compare solutions. Finally, the process is integrated into your work flow, allowing it to be accessed whenever it is needed. </p>

<h1>Projects</h1>
<p><b>24 hour scheduling for Alberta Health Services Emergency Department physicians</b></p> <p> Doctors work around the clock and at various
hospitals across Calgary. Creating a fair, safe and enjoyable work schedule becomes difficult to do by hand with more than about 20 doctors at a single location,
and impossible when there is more 80 at multiple locations. Talos Solver is used to generate the best possible schedule, and then 
allow for editing the result to meet specific cases. 
 </p>
  <h1>SBRP</h1>
<p>The school bus routing problem is a well known logistics topic.
 <a href="http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037722170900349X">Academic Papers</a> define the problem as:
 "SBRP seeks to plan an efficient schedule for a fleet of school buses where each bus picks up students from various bus stops and delivers them to their designated schools while satisfying various constraints such as the maximum capacity of a bus, the maximum riding time of a student in a bus, and the time window of a school. "</p>
<p>The Talos SBR focuses on the 'impossible' part of the problem: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicle_routing_problem">route selection</a>. Given that a school has existing limitations on bus stop locations, class times, and an existing transportation budget, the SBR will find the best bus routes. Improvements over existing routes are based on reduced bus count or size, reduced maximum student travel time, and reduced total travel time. </p>
<p>A critical feature of the Talos SBR is that pre-existing conditions can be included in the route selection, and the definition of "best" is customized to each model. For example, some schools require grouping by age on each bus, so the best route includes that rule.</p>
